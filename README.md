#Brain Tumor Detection using CNN
##Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It classifies scans as Tumor or No Tumor with high accuracy.
##Dataset
Souce: Kaggle Brain Tumor Dataset
Categories: Glioma,Meningioma,Pituitary,No Tumor
##Tools&Technologies
Python,TensorFlow,Keras
Google Colab
Matplotlib,NumPy,OpenCV
##Results
High accuracy on test data
Clear seperation between tumor and no tumor images
Training&validation accuracy graphs included
